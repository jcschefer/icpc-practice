1. opening: scan problems to find an easy problem
2. early game: 
	solve easy problems; 
	one/two work on first easy one while rest find other easy ones
3. mid game:
	go back to easy problems you haven't totally finished
	move on to medium problems
4. end game:
	go back, yet again, to ones you've tried before but not finished


General rule: after 5 submissions, move on and come back later
